[{"role":"user","content":"What is a \"serverless function\"?"},{"content":"A serverless function is a piece of code that is designed to run in a serverless computing environment. Serverless computing allows developers to build and deploy applications without having to worry about managing servers or infrastructure. The function is only executed when triggered by an event, such as an HTTP request or a database update, and the cloud provider automatically scales the resources needed to run the code. This allows for more efficient use of resources and cost savings for developers.","role":"assistant"}]
