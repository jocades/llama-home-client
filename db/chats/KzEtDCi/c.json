When sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in shorter, smaller waves. This causes the blue light to be scattered in all directions, giving the sky its blue appearance.","role":"assistant"}]}
