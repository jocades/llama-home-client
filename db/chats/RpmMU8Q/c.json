Here's an example of how you can use it:\n```\nuse rust_lex::{Lexer, Token};\n\nfn main() {\n    let source = \"Hello, world!\";\n    let mut lexer = Lexer::new(source);\n    \n    loop {\n        match lexer.next_token() {\n            Some(Token::Word(\"Hello\")) => println!(\"Found the word 'Hello'!\"),\n            Some(Token::Word(\"world\")) => println!(\"Found the word 'world'!\"),\n            None => break, // No more tokens\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code will create a lexer from the `source` string and loop over it to find the words \"Hello\" and \"world\". The `next_token()` method returns an `Option<Token>` that represents the next token in the input. You can then use the `match` statement to pattern match on the different types of tokens that your lexer can produce, such as keywords, punctuation, or identifiers.\n\nYou can also customize the behavior of the lexer by implementing your own `Lexer` trait and using it in place of the `rust_lex::Lexer`. This allows you to define your own token types and handle them in a specific way.\n```\nuse rust_lex::{Lexer, Token};\n\nstruct MyLexer {\n    source: &'static str,\n    pos: usize,\n}\n\nimpl Lexer for MyLexer {\n    fn next_token(&mut self) -> Option<Token> {\n        // Implement your own tokenization logic here\n        None\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we define a custom `MyLexer` struct that holds a reference to the input string and an iterator position. We then implement the `next_token()` method to return the next token from the input string.\n\nYou can also use other libraries like `nom`, `pest`, or `lexical-core` to create a lexer in Rust. These libraries provide more advanced features such as error handling, custom tokenization rules, and support for different file formats."}]}
