Here is a simple \"Hello World\" program in Haskell:\n```\nhello :: IO ()\nhello = putStrLn \"Hello, world!\"\n```\nThis program will output \"Hello, world!\" when it is run.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n* `hello` is the name of the function that we want to define.\n* `IO()` is a type alias for the `IO` monad, which represents an action that has effects on the outside world (e.g., printing to the console).\n* `putStrLn` is a function from the `System.IO` module that prints a line of text to the console.\n\nWhen we run this program, it will output \"Hello, world!\" to the console."}]
